                Hello, I'm a developer who absolutely loves coding‚Äîit's not just a job for me, it‚Äôs a passion. The beauty of a perfectly written line of code gets me pumped, and there's nothing more satisfying than seeing everything click into place. When I code, I don't just think about solutions‚ÄîI feel the code.
                <br><br>
                I‚Äôve got 2+ years of real-world experience in SLER projects, but don‚Äôt let the title fool you. While my stacks may sound like "basic" SLER tools‚ÄîJava and Spring‚Äîmy growth was anything but basic. In my first project, I was already at a skill level where the senior developers had little to say about my code. If they did, it was because they were wrong‚Äîand I was quick to prove it. I had to code portions of my senpai‚Äôs work because, frankly, I was faster and better, and they knew it. I was putting in crazy hours, often coding two days straight without sleep, pushing myself to the limit where my brain almost stopped functioning. But that‚Äôs where I gained my edge. While I may only have 2 years of experience on paper, my skill level is easily 1.5‚Äì2 times that of the average developer with the same experience. I‚Äôve earned my expertise, and I know how to solve problems that others can‚Äôt.
                <br><br>
                I pride myself on being super adaptive. Whether it's C# .NET or Shell scripting, I‚Äôve quickly picked up new languages and environments, no problem. When I first tackled C#, I was able to grasp the code without issues, despite it being a different ecosystem than Java. Sure, C# is just "Microsoft‚Äôs Java," but it still speaks volumes about my ability to adapt. Shell scripting? I hated it at first, but even with all the bizarre syntax, I tackled it head-on and adapted quickly. I also have a strong foundation in vanilla JavaScript and self-studied React.js, building my own app with it. While I haven‚Äôt worked with other JavaScript frameworks yet, I‚Äôm confident I can jump into any new front-end tech‚Äîor backend languages like PHP or Python‚Äîand make it my own.
                <br><br>
                Above all, I‚Äôm a problem solver. I don‚Äôt back down from a challenge. There was one time when two senior developers couldn‚Äôt figure out the cause of an issue after hours of troubleshooting. The team was stumped, so they called an SOS on team chat. I dove into the Git history, pinpointed the issue immediately, and solved it in minutes. Debugging errors, no matter how complex, is my bread and butter. After all those late-night coding sessions, I've built up a massive library of debugging techniques.
                <br><br>
                To sum it up: I‚Äôm a fast learner, a problem solver, and a coding fanatic who doesn‚Äôt settle for anything less than perfection. I don‚Äôt just write code‚ÄîI live it.
