                I'm a software developer with expertise in Java, JavaScript, Spring, React, Oracle, MySQL, and Shell
                scripting.
                I thrive in solving complex problems, optimizing code, and delivering efficient solutions.
                My skills go beyond coding‚ÄîI analyze issues, propose improvements, and contribute meaningfully to every
                project I work on.
                I may have two years of experience, but I perform at a level beyond that.
                I'm confident in debugging, system design, and algorithmic problem-solving, handling LeetCode easy and
                some medium problems with ease.
                My approach is logical, structured, and results-driven.
                I'm currently looking for a company in Japan that values skill over tenure, where I can make an impact
                and grow as a developer.

                        Participated in my first real-world software project in Japan.
                        The goal was to renovate the system due to a new health insurance standardization update while
                        also accommodating customer requests.
                        The new standardization introduced significant changes to health insurance items, leading to
                        modifications in database tables source codes.

                        I am currently working on a large-scale migration project that transitions from traditional CGI
                        to modern Spring Boot while incorporating additional customer requirements.
                        This is the largest system I have worked on so far, as I work alongside 15 developers on my team
                        and an additional 8 members from a separate team.
                        Consisting of both a browser-based interface and a mobile version, my primary responsibility is
                        the development and testing of the mobile version.
                        As we are in the integration testing phase, my daily tasks include running tests, reporting
                        issues on Redmine, and fixing identified errors.
                        Debugging has been particularly challenging since deployments are handled in a controlled
                        environment where I do not have direct access.
                        Without the convenience of a local debugger, I have learned to rely on checking log files with
                        WinSCP, running external programs directly on terminals with Teraterm, etc.
                        Despite these challenges, I have adapted and improved my problem-solving skills, further
                        enhancing my ability to navigate restricted environments.<br>
